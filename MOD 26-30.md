## Protocol Tunneling
### Protocol Encapsulation and Tunneling
- Tunneling is a network technique that masks the purpose of data, making it a useful technique for legitimate and malicious activities.
- Tunneling relies on protocol encapsulation.  

#### Protocol Encapsulation
- Protocol encapsulation is the process of wrapping data in the format of another protocol to ensure compatibility and efficient transmission across networks
- Tunneling uses protocol encapsulation to obscure data as it travels between two points.
- Although there are other uses of protocol encapsulation that are not tunneling, the primary use is tunneling, so they are often referred to interchangeably.
- This layered approach ensures that the inner protocol operates as expected, even across a network in which the protocol is not supported.

#### Tunneling
﻿- The primary goal of tunneling is to place a variety of traffic into a standardized package to ensure that all of the traffic ends up at the right place while also obscuring what is in the package from an outside view.
- This enables a variety of different services, such as Domain Name System (DNS) and Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, to function as if there is no separation between the networks. 

﻿

Tunneling bridges the gap between disparate network entities, often connecting private networks over the public internet. This is not only about connectivity; it is about creating secure, reliable pathways on an otherwise open and vulnerable internet. Consider the significance of tunneling in scenarios where remote access or site-to-site connections enable remote work and collaboration. Through tunneling, remote users gain access to central networks, and geographically separated offices operate as if they are connected to the same single network, as seen in Figure 27.1-2.

The Role of Encryption in Tunneling
﻿

Encryption is the process of encoding data so that it can only be accessed by authorized parties. When coupled with encryption, tunneling provides the assurance that the packaged traffic is obscured from unauthorized parties, as seen in Figure 27.1-3. The extent to which the traffic is safe or encrypted varies between different tunneling protocols. 

﻿

Encryption makes tunneling protocols such as IPsec, Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP), and OpenVPN useful for creating secure Virtual Private Networks (VPN). When data is tunneled through these encrypted channels, it becomes incredibly difficult for attackers to intercept, read, or manipulate the information.
