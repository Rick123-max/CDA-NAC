## Operationalizing Threat Intelligence
### Cyber Threat Intelligence Overview
- At its heart, intelligence is the science and art of understanding the enemy.
- As a discipline, intelligence is as old as warfare itself.
- Commanders have striven to predict the actions of their adversary, whether on a kinetic battlefield or in a futuristic cyberwar.
- Understanding the enemy’s capability and intent is the only way to make informed decisions on one’s own tactics to employ in response.
- Understanding the Operational Environment (OE) — the **conditions**, **circumstances**, and **influences** that affect the employment of capabilities — is paramount to making sound decisions in both offensive and defensive engagements.
- Traditionally in military intelligence, this refers to such things as the enemy’s **firepower**, **aggressiveness**, or **infrastructure** available to resupply their troops.
- In the cyber domain, direct correlations can be made to “traditional” intelligence. The product of these correlations forms CTI.

#### Intelligence in the Cyber Domain
- CTI is analyzed, actionable information, derived **internally** or **externally**, that aids an organization in **identifying**, **assessing**, **monitoring**, and **responding** to cyber threats.
- Because the cyber domain is now a major battlefield for crime, activism, and espionage, CTI has become increasingly essential to cyber defense.
- Relying on current and historical attack knowledge, an analyst can leverage CTI to prepare for future attacks on a defended terrain.
- Almost every tenet of traditional military intelligence can be applied to the cyber domain, not just in a military application.
- The cyber intelligence landscape is vast.
- It is unique in that there are thriving communities in both private and public sectors.
- The **private**, or **open-source**, intelligence community can be found in many different forums; **social media**, **vendor websites**, **blogs**, and **subscription services** are good examples.
- The government intelligence community, simply known as the “Intelligence Community” (**IC**), is less available to the public.
- Both these communities provide valuable resources to an analyst on a Cyber Protection Team (CPT).
- In fact, the CPT construct has an entire work role — the All-Source Analyst (ASA) — dedicated to interfacing with both the IC and open-source intelligence communities.
- Thanks to its countless devices and large intelligence communities, cyber, in general, has no shortage of “data.”
- Analysts use applications to collect data, they store data on servers, and they sift through telemetry data generated by anything that can ship a log.
- It is this data, or information, that eventually becomes intelligence.

#### Data vs. Intelligence
- Joint Publication 2-0, Joint Intelligence, Executive Summary, states the following about information (or “data”) vs. intelligence:
  - **_“Information on its own may be of utility to the commander, but when related to other information about the operational environment and considered in the light of past experience, it gives rise to a new understanding of the information, which may be termed ‘intelligence.’” _**

- In other words, analysis is what separates information from intelligence.
- For cyber defense, analysis is what makes data about threats in the cyber domain become CTI.
- For example, a Domain Name System (**DNS**) lookup for example[.]com is a piece of data.
- Further analysis may indicate that the domain is registered to Threat Actor, LLC, and can be tied to an ongoing espionage campaign.
- That extra analysis step is what makes data useful intelligence.

### The Intelligence Cycle
- Analysts need to understand the application and cyclical nature of CTI to be effective in countering active and future threats on a network.
- CDAs who are part of a CPT are not expected to perform formal intelligence analysis, but they are the consumers and, in some cases, collectors of intelligence.
- Maintaining realistic expectations and knowing what can be provided to the IC increases mission effectiveness throughout the execution of an operation.
- CTI follows the Intelligence Cycle, in which CDAs play an active role.
- Figure 6.1-1 illustrates the six steps of the cycle: **Direction**, **Collection**, **Processing**, **Analysis**, **Dissemination**, and **Feedback**.
  ![eed5e1d5-9f2e-481b-90d8-763547cd5c61](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a039dfb1-cadd-4fd9-be57-6a05e7358973)

#### Direction
- CTI analysis is always based on requirements.
- The **first step** of the Intelligence Cycle is to **define a clear requirement or question** for which intelligence should provide an answer.
- Often, for external intelligence, this requirement or question is submitted to an intelligence analyst in the form of a **Request for Information (RFI)**.
  - Uses for intelligence are numerous, so RFIs may ask a wide variety of questions.
- CDAs likely are most concerned with obtaining or collecting tactical intelligence for immediate use defending a network.
- Sometimes, a CPT may be employed to answer or collect information on intelligence requirements given by a higher tasking authority.

#### Collection
- The collection of cyber intelligence is typically the **process of collecting data from networks useful in tracking a threat**.
- However, it may come in other forms as well, such as reading a news article for political or economic information pertaining to a mission partner’s organization or viewing data from an open honeypot provided by researchers on the internet.
- At this point in the cycle, this is just data and not yet intelligence.
- **Collection is not a one-time effort**.
  - It comes in cycles of its own.
  - For example, a CDA may find a suspicious Internet Protocol (IP) address thought to be Command-and-Control (C2) communication to a malicious server.
  - The next cycle of collection on that data might be identifying what domain resolves to that address, followed by a cycle of collecting certificate information on that domain.
  - The cycle continues until enough data is collected to meet the requirement defined prior to collection.

#### Processing
- An analyst should not overlook the importance of processing data to be usable.
- A CDA’s analysis platform should be flexible and configurable enough to view a multitude of different data types in a normalized way.
  - For example, collected logs from firewalls may have different formats, depending on their type or brand.
- It is more useful if a CDA can process the log data to conform to a standard format than if they must manually interpret and compare the logs separately.
- The creation of **visualizations** also falls into the Processing step.
  - **Visualizing data** can greatly **assist a CDA or ASA in identifying trends** and **answering questions proposed** to the intelligence process as a whole.

#### Analysis
- **CTI analysis is based on requirements**.
- Without a requirement, the analysis has no question to answer.
- This is the step in which **data becomes intelligence**.
- Questions asked, or requirements presented, in the initial step of the cycle (Direction) are answered using analysis.
- The Analysis step is distinct from Processing.
  - Whereas the Processing step is usually automated or involves only manipulating data, analysis is done exclusively by a human.
  - This is where a CDA interprets the data that was collected and processed in previous steps.

#### Dissemination
- Intelligence is a shared commodity.
- It should be shared with the entity that requested the information, and it is often shared with a larger community of intelligence analysts.
- CDAs should concern themselves with this step because the format and completeness of the collected data and analysis directly affect the value of the dissemination of intelligence.
- ASAs are leveraged in the step to disseminate intelligence back to the IC.

#### Feedback
- The last step of the Intelligence Cycle is Feedback.
- Did the analysis properly answer the requirement?
  - This is a question that CDAs should answer if requesting or analyzing intelligence.
  - If the intelligence fails to meet the requirement, a new cycle is started in which the error is corrected or intelligence gaps are identified more fully.

### Levels of Intelligence
- When dealing with consuming or collecting intelligence on a network, intelligence comes in different forms and at different levels, depending on requirements given to an analyst.
- Consider the following examples:
  - The political motivations of a threat group.
  - A list of APTs assessed to have the capability and intent to target a mission partner’s network.
  - Domains tied to a specific APT for use in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).
- Each example represents a different level of intelligence that a CPT may request or be required to fill.
- The three levels, or **taxonomic categories**, of intelligence are **strategic**, **operational**, and **tactical**.
  - The first example listed above represents strategic intelligence; the second, operational intelligence; and the third, tactical intelligence.

#### Strategic Intelligence
- Attacker **motivations**, **politics**, or **trends** that **inform an organization’s policy decisions and planning** represent the **strategic** level of intelligence.
- Often, strategic intelligence is the **trigger for the start of an operation** or a **change to network architecture**.

#### Operational Intelligence
- Attacker **Tactics**, **Techniques**, and **Procedures** (**TTP**) and **capability** are typically viewed as **operational** intelligence.
- This intelligence **informs collection plans** and **mission-planning efforts** **prior to an incident response or hunt engagement**.

#### Tactical Intelligence
- **Immediately applicable intelligence**, such as Indicators of Compromise (**IOC**), **antivirus signatures**, or **IDS rules**, fall into the **tactical** level of intelligence.
- This intelligence is **most useful for CDAs** on a mission **during on-network engagements and retroactive investigations**.

### Strategic Intelligence
- Cyberspace does not exist in a vacuum.
- Strategic intelligence deals with **external**, and **often global**, **influences** on the cyber threat landscape.
- The following are example intelligence requirements that pertain to the strategic level of intelligence:
  - Based on new political developments in the region, what threat groups may be motivated to attack the mission partner’s network?
  - Which trends in cybersecurity indicate a threat to the mission partner’s attack surface?
  - Should active cyber threats dictate a change in collaboration software for the organization?

- As illustrated in these examples, **strategic-level intelligence** deals with **threat actor trends and motivations** and **informs policy decisions**.
- Strategic-level questions have **real financial impact** and may **inform the movement of defense efforts**.
- This intelligence can assist all analysts by **giving context to defense efforts**, even at the most basic and direct levels.

#### Application of Strategic CTI
- During a CPT mission or planning of such a mission, **strategic intelligence** plays an important role in **comprehensively understanding the network environment**.
- In fact, a subset of strategic intelligence called **warning intelligence** is one of the **three main triggers for CPT employment**. (The other two triggers are **campaign planning and detected malicious cyber activity**.)
- Additional characteristics of strategic CTI are as follows:
  - Strategic CTI provides a comprehensive view of the target or attacker, to include motivations, resources, and capability.
    - This can come in the form of target profiles, briefings, or reports.
  - Strategic CTI seeks to predict future attacks based on trends and other forms of intelligence collection.
  - Strategic CTI provides input to planning and policy development.
    - Sometimes it can inform policies on mission partner networks as a by-product of a mission’s final report.
- This all adds up to the explanation of what a CDA should be worried about — or, more specifically, whom a CDA should be worried about — when defending a network.

#### Who Is the Enemy?
- Strategic intelligence boils down to one big question: **“Who is the enemy?”**
- This is not a question to completely craft collection plans around, but it is an **intelligence requirement** that is **fundamental to every decision made** when it comes to **employing CPTs** and other defense teams.
  - For example, assume that a specific organization’s most likely enemy, based on strategic-level intelligence, is motivated by financial gain and is known to sell stolen intellectual property.
  - Knowing nothing else about the network or organization, how would that inform mission planning or network architecture decisions?
    - If the organization in this example is attacked by the most likely enemy, the following is true:
      - Data exfiltration of intellectual property is likely.
      - The servers with the most valuable information are most likely the targets.
      - The attack comes from outside the organization (so the enemy is not an insider).
- These assumptions and intelligence most likely lead the organization to invest in greater protection of the sensitive data or servers and possibly to consider a standalone network for valuable intellectual property.
- The above conclusions from the example intelligence would likely drive follow-on requirements to narrow down TTPs or IOCs for analysis.

### Attribution to the Enemy
- **Attribution is not the job of a CDA**.
- However, attribution is an **important aspect of CTI**.
- Knowing (or assessing) who attacked, or will attack, a network is essential to policy makers and planners.
- Having no idea who attacked a network makes it impossible to track campaigns or anticipate future attacks from any particular entity.
- Furthermore, CDAs can use existing attribution information to more quickly identify and counter a threat actor on a defended network.
- Even though attribution is not the responsibility of a CDA, it is **important to know how CDAs contribute to the process** and **how attribution decisions are made by the IC**.
- By knowing the steps and information needed to attribute an APT, CDAs can distinguish between the threat groups more easily. 

#### Threat Group Tracking
- The concept of a threat group is often misleading.
- What makes up a threat group or APT?
  - Sometimes they are tied and attributed to government agencies, sometimes they are crime organizations, and sometimes they are synonymous with the malware they are known to use.
  - An even more perplexing question is: How is tracking a threat group possible? Why don’t APTs simply change their tactics after every attack?
- **Threat groups**, as a concept, are a **conglomerate of tendencies and identifiable tactics** that **allow for researchers and intelligence analysts to identify patterns**.
  - These patterns are possible, and necessary, for threat groups to operate.
  - After all, when APTs are thought of as someone’s job, patterns make sense.
  - For example, a fast-food restaurant does not serve different hamburgers if someone calls in sick. Threat groups operate similarly.
  - To achieve repeatable success with a team of operators, a repeatable process needs to be implemented. That repeatable process becomes a trackable threat group.
  - In fact, most tracked threat groups are an abstraction and primarily equate to a set of instructions that humans follow, not to the humans themselves.

- Attribution of APTs to organizations that exist outside cyberspace is more challenging than identifying patterns and tactics.
- **Motives**, **politics**, and other **non-technical attributes** need to be analyzed to make that kind of determination. 
- **Tracking threat groups, from a CDA perspective**, is important because it **creates sets of TTPs** that can be **searched** and **planned** for on a network.
- Without having a predictable set of behaviors to search for, analysts are left with virtually infinite combinations of TTPs to plan for.

#### What’s in a Name?
- **Naming APTs or threat groups** is necessary and is a **standard practice for every organization** that tracks them.
- Being able to identify a group with a **short name** is obviously **preferable** to using something like “that group that uses phishing and password spraying and is assessed to be from East Asia.”

- However useful the naming of threat groups may be, every entity that tracks these groups names the groups based on their own criteria.
  - Vendor A’s tracking of a group is not necessarily the same as Vendor B’s.
  - A common misconception of the CTI community is that direct equivalencies exist between threat groups tracked by different vendors.
  - There is a reason for the lack of equivalency: **perspective**.
  - For example, consider the following scenario.
    - Imagine two CTI entities looking at the same attack: one is a vendor who specializes in host-based antivirus, and another is a vendor specializing in firewalls.
    - They each have their own telemetry and data on the incident.
    - It is reasonable to think that the antivirus vendor focuses on the malware signatures on the host and the firewall vendor has a deep understanding of the C2 traffic leaving the network.
    - The use of the same malware in a follow-on attack, but with modified C2 patterns, may cause the firewall vendor to attribute these two attacks to different groups but the antivirus to continue attributing to the original group.
  - This is an unrealistically simplified example, but it illustrates how viewing threat groups from different perspectives causes attribution of APTs to diverge over time.
  - Zooming the example out even more, consider entities that deal in CTI but are not vendors.
  - Such entities as cybersecurity vendors are quite interested in detectable attributes that can protect their customers’ networks, but entities like government agencies tend to be more interested in attribution to humans or other governments.
  - This tends to make attribution by government agencies lean more toward nontechnical attributes of a threat group.
  - CPTs have to take all these perspectives into account when determining which TTPs and APTs to target.
- Keeping this naming and tracking perspective in mind, security researchers and intelligence analysts use a standard framework for attribution decisions: **Malware**, **Infrastructure**, **Control Server**, **Telemetry**, **Intelligence**, and **Cui Bono**, or **MICTIC**.

### MICTIC Framework
#### Overview
- CDAs need to know what type of information is helpful for the IC to have to make attribution decisions so that it can be collected while on mission.
- It is also important to know that a single artifact is often not enough to make official attribution decisions.
- The MICTIC Framework, as described in Timo Steffens’ book Attribution of Advanced Persistent Threats: How to Identify the Actors Behind Cyber-Espionage, is a standard method to tie attack campaigns and attributes to threat groups or sometimes even declare a brand new threat group discovered.
- The MICTIC Framework comprises six evidence categories of an attribution decision:
  - **Malware**
    - Intelligence analysts can track and attribute APTs based on the malware they employ on victim networks.
    - This may seem obvious. However, taking things a step further, some APTs outsource the authoring of malware for their own use.
    - That relationship between the author and the entity that employs the malware is also good evidence for attribution.
    - It may also assist in identifying nefarious relationships between malware authors and multiple APTs.
    - Evidence that CDAs can provide includes **malware samples** and **sandbox reports**.
  - **Infrastructure**
    - The pathways that C2 takes to and from victim networks provide a good indication of who is attacking a network.
    - In fact, some larger nation-state APTs have teams with the sole purpose of setting up infrastructure.
    - By investigating things like **domain name registration** and **IP address ownership**, a pattern may emerge that points to known bad actors.
    - Evidence that CDAs can provide includes **packet captures**, **domain names**, **IP addresses**, and **certificate information**.
  - **Control server**
    - Typically, the Control Server evidence is seized by law enforcement or government agencies from attacker-owned or -rented servers.
    - Certain things like language **settings**, **certificates**, **user accounts**, and **saved files** are quite useful in positively identifying not only threat groups but also human operators.
    - Evidence that CDAs can provide includes **packet captures to C2 servers from victim networks**.
  - **Telemetry**
    - Information logged from **inside victim networks**, such as **command-line logs**, **IDS alerts**, and **antivirus messages**, provide analysts with a **treasure trove of information** useful for attribution.
    - For example, evidence of attacker interactivity on a network that happens only during working hours in Moscow and stops on Russian national holidays might be a good indication the threat group is based in Russia.
    - Evidence that CDAs can provide includes **log information ingested into analysis platforms** and **crew logs indicating observed attacker behavior**.
  - **Intelligence**
    - Of the six evidence categories in the MICTIC Framework, **Intelligence** and **Cui Bono** are the two that **CDAs have little to do with**.
    - **Governments** and **researchers** have the ability to **aggregate many pieces of information** and **collect intelligence that may indicate an attacker's identity** outside a victim’s network.
    - **Intelligence** may be from a **human source**, **intercepted communications**, or any other **traditional intelligence source**.
    - **Cui Bono**
      - An **analysis** of **who would benefit** from the attack **politically**, **financially**, or otherwise.

#### MICTIC Application
- By analyzing each evidence type and comparing it to a known set of APTs, researchers and intelligence analysts can make informed attribution decisions.
- Some attributions are made with more confidence, whereas others may be made with less confidence but still show ties and similarities between attacks.
- Again, making attribution decisions is not a CDA’s job.
- It is, however, highly important from a strategic standpoint for leaders to assess who has attacked, or might attack, in the future.
- Also, **attribution** allows for an analyst to **more effectively plan for**, or **quickly react to**, active **intrusions** on **mission partner networks**. 


### Operational Intelligence
- **Strategic intelligence**, by definition, is **long term** and, as illustrated in the previous section, **takes considerable effort to track and apply**.
- Once stakeholders and analysts are aware of the strategic intelligence for their operating environment, more granularity is needed for operationalizing that intelligence.

- **Operational intelligence** is **higher-level information** on **campaigns** and threat actor **TTPs**.
  - It deals with more **immediately applicable intelligence** to **mission planning and operations**.
  - For example, **strategic intelligence** may **indicate an APT** to initiate a hunt mission for, but **operational intelligence** provides the **TTPs** and **capabilities** of that APT to plan the mission around.

- As each level of intelligence is explained, strong connections between each level are evident.
- For example, operational intelligence on TTPs of attackers is not possible without first using strategic intelligence to attribute and anticipate the adversary.
- Likewise, tactical intelligence relies on operational intelligence to determine what directly pertains to a defended terrain.

- Operational intelligence is **high-level**, but **short-term**, **intelligence**.
- It does not get into IOCs or specific commands an attacker might run on a victim network, but it does **deal with fluid topics like TTPs**.
- It is **observable** and relates to **specific attacks or attack campaigns**, as opposed to the broader approach that strategic intelligence provides.

#### Intelligence in Operations
- Attacker capabilities and intent are the cornerstones of operational intelligence.
- After identifying who the enemy is, the next logical questions asked are “What can the enemy do?” and “What does the enemy want?”
- Based on intelligence and data collected from previous attacks, repeated patterns related to TTPs and actions on objectives by the attacker can give analysts in CPTs insight into what to expect while on mission.

#### Attacker Capabilities
- The capabilities of an APT directly relate to the resources they have available.
- Do they create their own custom malware? Are they able to purchase hundreds of domains on the internet? Do they enhance their operations with their own intelligence collection?
- APTs with the most resources will obviously have the most advanced capabilities.
- When defending against or hunting for attackers with advanced capabilities, it is reasonable to assume that traditional methods of detecting malicious activity on a network will not work.
  - As an example, for a well-resourced APT, antivirus will most likely be ineffective. 
- Similarly, detecting attackers with advanced capabilities is resource intensive.
- Resource intensive might mean it is **expensive**, requires **deeper analysis**, or takes **more time to detect**.
- This creates an imbalance if a highly capable attacker targets a resource stretched organization.

#### Attacker Intent
- Knowing or assessing what an attacker is attempting to accomplish on a victim network makes defending against that attack possible.
- Operational intelligence seeks to determine what an attacker or attack campaign is trying to accomplish based on strategic intelligence indicators.


### Applied TTPs
- Dealing with capabilities and intent goes only so far when planning the defense of a network.
- Knowing, for example, that an attack campaign indicates that an APT is using open-source malware and is altering valuable information on victim networks indicates attacker intent and capabilities.
  - However, this gives only vague information.
- There are more intelligence requirements to be met when planning a defense.
  - Specifically, how does the attacker operate?
- Consider the following, for example:
  - How does the attacker typically gain initial access?
  - What method is usually used for persistence on a host?
  - Will the CPT be able to see clear text communications in network traffic?
  - How much time passes between initial foothold and actions on objective?

- These intelligence requirements all point to TTPs.
- Knowing and mapping TTPs of an APT give an analyst something concrete to build their defense around.

- Using such tools as the **MITRE ATT&CK® framework**, intelligence analysts can effectively communicate operational level intelligence to a CDA in the form of TTPs.
- In essence, an **ATT&CK matrix describing an APT is that threat group’s fingerprint**.
- After all, as discussed early in this lesson, threat groups are merely an abstraction of linked TTPs.

- **Combining APT capability**, **intent**, and **known TTPs** can provide a CPT with the following information:
  - The amount of resources needed to defend a network.
  - Where on the network will be targeted.
  - How the attacker will attempt to accomplish their goal.
- Absent specific IOCs and signatures, this is enough information for a CPT to plan an entire operation around. 


### Tactical Intelligence
- In cyber defense, tactical intelligence is low-level and short-lived intelligence that allows direct response to cyber threats.
- As detailed in the sports example above, it is also the **easiest intelligence type for an attacker to alter**.
- Its perishable nature requires that it is refreshed often, but accurate and timely tactical intelligence can prove invaluable in an **active situation** or **retroactive investigation**.

#### Uses for Tactical Intelligence
- In a cyber defense application, tactical intelligence can be applied directly to an analysis platform and other tools that a CDA uses to interact with an environment.
- Most notably, it is conveyed in the form of IOC.
- Other forms of tactical intelligence are exact commands run on a system by an attacker or other observable tendencies like usernames or network traffic signatures.
- Tactical intelligence has two main uses: **active hunting or engagements** and **retroactive investigations**.
  - Using it during an active engagement can assist CDAs in directly countering a threat.
  - Tactical intelligence during retroactive investigations can provide evidence that malicious activity occurred.

#### Active Hunting
- Using IOCs, IDS signatures, and other readily applicable intelligence on a network during an active intrusion or hunt can deliver quick wins for an analyst.
- By using intelligence on active campaigns or attacks currently happening in cyberspace, relevant indicators can be ingested into an analysis tool for low-effort discovery and countering of attackers on a network.

- However, challenges exist with tactical intelligence in an active environment.
- One challenge is that tactical indicators are easy for attackers to change.
  - By accumulating a large number of IOCs from online repositories or internal intelligence databases, the processing and storage overhead is often not commensurate with the value of the data.
- Another challenge is that commonly, by the time tactical intelligence becomes processed and disseminated, it has already become stale.
  - Also, related to that point, many attackers change their identifiable tactical level signatures between every attack.

#### Retroactive Investigations
- Using known IOCs and other observables when reviewing logs for an investigation of a confirmed attack can be highly valuable.
- The inherent issues with tactical-level intelligence applied to active situations do not exist with retroactive forensics.
- In fact, stale IOCs may be more useful than current information.
- Looking back in time using known indicators may reveal more and provide for a more complete picture of the incident because the more time that passes, the more likely that information will be available for intelligence analysts to disseminate.


### RFI Process
- The process of requesting information or intelligence from the IC or a commercial intelligence team may be formalized, depending on the assigned unit, command, or organization.
- Typically, this function is performed by the ASA in a CPT, but the act of initiating a requirement may be the responsibility of a CDA.
- Although CPTs have assigned intelligence personnel, certain research and information gathering tasks still fall on CDAs.
- This section introduces the process of submitting an RFI and how to interpret its response.

#### The RFI Submission
- To receive specific intelligence about any particular topic or mission, a request must be submitted to the IC.
- Typically, submitting something to the IC means that an intelligence analyst assigned to a higher command does research on the topic and submits a response.
- Stating “Submitted to the IC” really means that it is given to another analyst or team of analysts to query for information on another system.
- If the intelligence requested does not exist already to answer a requirement, the Intelligence Cycle begins, with the RFI serving as the direction.
- Understandably, the entire Intelligence Cycle may take some time to complete, so it is important to be flexible but up front if the due date is swiftly approaching.

#### RFI Criteria
- The request itself should meet certain criteria.
- The IC expects certain items, as follows, to be included in order to respond with a useful answer.

#### Requestor/Requestee
- The RFI should indicate who requested the information, along with good contact information for any follow-up questions or clarifications needed by the intelligence analysts working the request.
- An alternate contact for the request is also helpful, especially in time-sensitive requests.

#### Request
- A request is a straightforward, simple question or requirement that needs to be answered.
- There is an art to crafting a request that leads to an appropriate response.
- After all, intelligence analysts are not mind readers.
- CDAs should be as precise and direct as possible and include an example of the response they are expecting.

#### Due Date
- Depending on where the RFI is addressed, it could be competing with a long list of other requests. Due dates are used to prioritize competing requests.

#### References
- For intelligence analysts to expedite research, it is important that they know which resources have already been checked.
